	This was made with HTML and CSS, and admittedly took much longer than anticipated to build. It was inspired by <a target ="_blank" href = "https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page"> flexdinesh/dev-landing-page. </a> </div>
	<div class ="blog">
	<h2 class = "h2-heading"> Blog </h2>

	<p class ="blog-post"> This is my first time making a github page. It was a little challening, but a lot of fun learning how to make little tweaks and getting to add new features. I want to be able to make the smooth transition animations to go to each section, so that the "About" and "Blog" section aren't just crammed into the front page. I'm not sure how to make it so that they are visible once you scroll down. Kind of embarrassing having all of my thoughts right away. </p>
